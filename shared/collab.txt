For all collaborators,

- Do not directly commit to the main branch of the repo; instead create a new branch, commit to that and then make a pull request. More on pull requests: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests

- Please make an issue in the *Issues tab* of the repo if you encounter any issues, for discussion.
